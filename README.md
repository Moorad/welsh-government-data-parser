This project was part of a university assignment. The assignment required us to create a C++ application that would parse the given welsh government data and convert it to different formats such as JSON and CSV and provide statistics (average, min, max, etc).

~~In this submission I have included all the methods that were marked TODO and passed all the unit and output tests on autograder. Some auxilary functions were used but they have comments explaining their functionality so it should not be too difficult to understand.~~

~~No known cavets or issues with implementation however case-insensitivity was not tested thoroughly.~~

~~The compiler used in development is g++ version 9.4.0. The code was compiled and run on Linux Ubuntu (Windows WSL)~~
